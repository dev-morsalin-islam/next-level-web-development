-- sql is a declarative language. I don't need to think about how it works

-- in this file we will work with postgresql


-- MAKE  FUNCTION

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION DOUBLE_NUMBER(PARAM_NUMBER INT)
RETURNS INT
LANGUAGE SQL
AS
$$
    SELECT PARAM_NUMBER * 2;
$$;

SELECT DOUBLE_NUMBER(20);

-- NOTE: IF WE USE LANGUAGE SQL WE CAN'T DEFINE VARIABLE, CAN'T PERFORM LOOP OR ANY COMPLEX LOGIC

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION SQUARE_NUMBER(PARAM_NUMBER INT)
RETURNS INT 
LANGUAGE SQL
AS  
$$
    SELECT PARAM_NUMBER * PARAM_NUMBER;
$$;


SELECT SQUARE_NUMBER(10);
